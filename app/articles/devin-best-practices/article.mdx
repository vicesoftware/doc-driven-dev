Working effectively with AI developers like Devin requires a structured approach. Here's a comprehensive guide on best practices based on real-world experience.

## 1. Use DocDD.ai Approach

The foundation of working effectively with Devin is following the DocDD.ai approach:

- **Break Down Work**: Get your work assignments as small as possible while including maximum details
- **Treat Like an Intern**: Approach Devin as you would a skilled intern - clear instructions and well-defined scope
- **Structured Epics**: Break larger projects into manageable stories
  - Example: An "Invoices" epic might contain separate stories for:
    - Database setup
    - API development
    - User interface design

## 2. Definition of Done

Establishing clear completion criteria is crucial:

- **Ownership**: Give Devin ownership of its definition of done
- **Test-Driven Development**: Tests are the most effective way to verify completion
  - Set up CI in GitHub for automated test runs
  - While local testing is possible, some environments (like Supabase) may present challenges
- **Task Completion**: Always instruct Devin to create tests and consider the task complete only when tests pass

## 3. Working Through Pull Requests

Maintain a professional development workflow:

- **Requirements Reference**: Provide tasks with clear references to requirements
  - Use GitHub issues or markdown files in source code
- **PR Review Process**: Devin will create pull requests that you can review just like any developer's work

## 4. Verification Process

Always verify Devin's work thoroughly:

- **Local Testing**: Pull the branch and run tests locally
- **AI-Assisted Review**: Use tools like Cursor, Cline, or Aider to:
  - Review test coverage
  - Verify requirements alignment
  - Get feedback on test quality

## Best Practices Summary

1. Break down tasks into small, detailed pieces
2. Establish clear definitions of done through tests
3. Use proper PR workflows
4. Verify work thoroughly using both manual and AI-assisted methods

> Remember, the key to success with Devin is treating it as a capable team member while maintaining clear structure and verification processes.
