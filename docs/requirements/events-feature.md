# Events Feature Implementation

This document outlines the steps needed to implement the upcoming events feature. The implementation should strictly follow the patterns and approaches established in the existing Articles feature, reusing components and patterns wherever possible.

## Overview
The events feature will mirror the Articles feature structure with:
- A main events listing page (following the same layout as `/app/articles/page.tsx`)
- An events repeater component on the home page (similar to ArticleRepeater)
- Individual event detail pages (following `/app/articles/[slug]/page.tsx` pattern)

## Process
When working on the Tasks in this feature implementation, follow these steps:
1. Pick the next tasks that isn't inprogress
2. Create a new branch for the task
3. Implement the task
4. Ask the developer to test the feature
5. Once approved, commit the changes, merge the branch and close the task by updating it's status in this document
6. Move on to the next task

## Tasks

### ✅ 1. Article Feature Analysis and Refactoring
**Priority**: Highest
**Status**: Completed
**Can be done in parallel**: No (this is a prerequisite for other tasks)
- Review current Articles implementation
- Identify reusable components (article cards, list layouts, etc.)
- Refactor Articles components to be more generic
- Create shared components for:
  - Content cards
  - List layouts
  - MDX content rendering (reused existing)
  - Metadata handling
- Update Articles feature to use new shared components

### ⏳ 2. Events List Page
**Priority**: High
**Status**: Not Started
**Can be done in parallel**: Yes (after step 1)
- Create events content structure in `/app/events/content`
- Define event metadata schema (date, title, description, location)
- Create `/app/events/page.tsx`
- Implement event list layout and styling
- Add sorting functionality (by date)
- Include event cards with key information
- Add filtering capabilities (optional)

### ⏳ 3. Event Detail Pages
**Priority**: High
**Status**: Not Started
**Can be done in parallel**: Yes (after step 1)
- Create sample event MDX files for testing
- Create dynamic route structure for individual events
- Implement `/app/events/[slug]/page.tsx`
- Create event detail layout
- Add event metadata display
- Include registration/RSVP functionality (if required)

### ⏳ 4. Home Page Integration
**Priority**: Medium
**Status**: Not Started
**Can be done in parallel**: Yes (after step 1)
- Create an EventRepeater component
- Add the component to the home page
- Show upcoming events (next 3-5)
- Include "View All Events" link

### ⏳ 5. Shared Components
**Priority**: Medium
**Status**: Not Started
**Can be done in parallel**: Yes (after step 1)
- Create reusable EventCard component
- Implement event date formatting utilities
- Add shared styling for event displays

### ⏳ 6. Layout and Navigation
**Priority**: Medium
**Status**: Not Started
**Can be done in parallel**: Yes
- Create `/app/events/layout.tsx`
- Add events to main navigation
- Implement breadcrumb navigation
- Ensure responsive design

### ⏳ 7. Testing and Documentation
**Priority**: High
**Status**: Not Started
**Can be done in parallel**: No (should be done last)
- Add test cases for event components
- Document event content creation process
- Create usage examples
- Test across different screen sizes

## Technical Considerations
- Use MDX for event content with the same structure as articles
- Implement static rendering for event list and detail pages
- Main events page (`/app/events/page.tsx`) should be a Server Component
- Individual event pages should use Client Components ('use client') for interactive features
- Use Next.js Image component with proper optimization for event images
- Maintain consistent metadata structure for SEO
- Handle date formatting on the server side where possible
- Ensure proper static asset handling for event images
- Follow the same MDX content structure:
  - Event content files in `/app/events/[slug]/event.mdx`
  - Event pages in `/app/events/[slug]/page.tsx`
  - Shared layout in `/app/events/layout.tsx`
- Implement date handling for upcoming/past events
- Consider timezone handling for event times
- Ensure SEO optimization for event pages

## Status Key
- ✅ Completed: Task is finished and ready for review
- 🔄 In Progress: Task is currently being worked on
- ⏳ Not Started: Task hasn't been started yet
- ❌ Blocked: Task is blocked by dependencies or issues
