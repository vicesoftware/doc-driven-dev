# Events Feature Implementation

This document outlines the steps needed to implement the upcoming events feature. The implementation should strictly follow the patterns and approaches established in the existing Articles feature, reusing components and patterns wherever possible.

## Overview
The events feature will mirror the Articles feature structure with:
- A main events listing page (following the same layout as `/app/articles/page.tsx`)
- An events repeater component on the home page (similar to ArticleRepeater)
- Individual event detail pages (following `/app/articles/[slug]/page.tsx` pattern)

## Process
When working on the Tasks in this feature implementation, follow these steps:
1. Pick the next tasks that isn't inprogress
2. Implement the task
3. Ask the developer to test the feature
4. Once approved, commit the changes and close the task by updating it's status in this document
5. Move on to the next task

### ✅ 3. Event Detail Pages
**Priority**: High
**Status**: Completed
**Can be done in parallel**: Yes (after step 1)

**Status**: Not Started
**Can be done in parallel**: Yes (after step 1)

- Add the component to the home page
- Show upcoming events (next 3-5)
- Include "View All Events" link

### ✅ 5. Shared Components
**Priority**: Medium
**Status**: Completed
**Can be done in parallel**: Yes (after step 1)

- ✅ Add shared styling for event displays

### ✅ 6. Layout and Navigation

**Status**: Completed
**Can be done in parallel**: Yes
- ✅ Create `/app/events/layout.tsx`
- ✅ Add events to main navigation

- ✅ Ensure responsive design

### ✅ 7. Testing and Documentation
**Priority**: High
**Status**: Completed
**Can be done in parallel**: No
- ✅ Test all event pages and components
- ✅ Verify responsive design
- ✅ Document component usage
- ✅ Update feature documentation

## Feature Status: ✅ Completed

All tasks have been completed and tested. The Events feature is now fully implemented with:
- Event listing and detail pages
- Home page integration
- Shared components (EventCard, Breadcrumb)
- Date formatting utilities
- Responsive design
- Navigation and layout

## Technical Considerations
- Use MDX for event content with the same structure as articles
- Implement static rendering for event list and detail pages
- Main events page (`/app/events/page.tsx`) should be a Server Component
- Individual event pages should use Client Components ('use client') for interactive features
- Use Next.js Image component with proper optimization for event images
- Maintain consistent metadata structure for SEO
- Handle date formatting on the server side where possible
- Ensure proper static asset handling for event images
- Follow the same MDX content structure:
  - Event content files in `/app/events/[slug]/event.mdx`
  - Event pages in `/app/events/[slug]/page.tsx`
  - Shared layout in `/app/events/layout.tsx`
- Implement date handling for upcoming/past events
- Consider timezone handling for event times
- Ensure SEO optimization for event pages

## Status Key
- ✅ Completed: Task is finished and ready for review
- 🔄 In Progress: Task is currently being worked on
- ⏳ Not Started: Task hasn't been started yet
- ❌ Blocked: Task is blocked by dependencies or issues
