# Image Loading Optimization Plan

## Background

The application is experiencing image loading issues when deployed to Digital Ocean App Platform, specifically:
- Initial page loads trigger 504 timeout errors
- Images fail to load immediately after deployment/cold starts
- Performance improves "after a while" suggesting caching issues
- Using Next.js static export with custom image loader

## Current Implementation

- Next.js with `output: 'export'` for static generation
- Sharp for image optimization
- Custom image loader for Digital Ocean hosted images
- Images served directly through App Platform

## Action Plan

### 1. Infrastructure Optimization üèóÔ∏è

- [~] Move images to Digital Ocean Spaces
  - ‚úì Create Space: doc-driven-dev-space.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com
  - ‚úì Configure AWS CLI with Space credentials (profile: doc-driven-dev-spaces)
  - ‚úì Convert and optimize images to WebP format
  - ‚úì Upload optimized images to Space
  - [ ] Update component image references to use Space URLs
  - ‚úì Separate static assets from application code
  - ‚úì Better scalability and management
  - [ ] Enable CDN integration
  - **Detailed implementation plans:**
    - [DO-SPACES-MIGRATION.md](DO-SPACES-MIGRATION.md)
    - [IMAGE-ENVIRONMENT-STRATEGY.md](IMAGE-ENVIRONMENT-STRATEGY.md) (Environment-specific image handling)

- [ ] Enable CDN for Spaces
  - [ ] Configure CDN endpoints
  - [ ] Verify cache headers are working:
    ```
    Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000
    ```
  - [ ] Monitor CDN performance and costs

- [ ] Review App Platform Configuration
  - [ ] Increase instance size if needed
  - [ ] Configure minimum running instances to prevent cold starts
  - [ ] Review and adjust timeout settings

### 2. Image Processing Pipeline üñºÔ∏è

- [‚úì] Implement pre-optimization workflow
  - ‚úì Set up sharp-cli for batch processing
  - ‚úì Create optimization script for build process
  - ‚úì Define standard image sizes and formats
  - **Details in: [Image Preprocessing Guide](IMAGE-PREPROCESSING.md)**

- [‚úì] Generate multiple formats
  - ‚úì Convert images to WebP with fallbacks
  - ‚úì Create responsive sizes for common breakpoints
  - ‚úì Generated sizes: 640px, 750px, 828px, 1080px, 1200px, 1920px

- [‚úì] Optimize existing images
  - ‚úì Audit current image sizes and formats
  - ‚úì Batch process existing images
  - ‚úì Verify quality vs file size balance

### 3. Caching Strategy üì¶

- [ ] Implement client-side caching
  - [ ] Configure service worker for image caching
  - [ ] Set up proper cache invalidation
  - [ ] Monitor cache hit rates

- [ ] Add server-side caching layer
  - [ ] Set up Redis or similar caching solution
  - [ ] Configure cache timeouts
  - [ ] Implement cache warming for critical images

### 4. Code Optimizations üíª

- [~] Update image loader implementation
  - ‚úì Handle DO Spaces URLs
  - ‚úì Implement responsive size selection
  - ‚úì Add WebP support
  - [ ] Test edge cases and fallbacks
  - **Environment handling: [IMAGE-ENVIRONMENT-STRATEGY.md](IMAGE-ENVIRONMENT-STRATEGY.md)**

- [ ] Implement lazy loading
  - [ ] Add loading="lazy" to below-fold images
  - [ ] Consider implementing intersection observer
  - [ ] Add blur placeholder images

### 5. Monitoring & Analytics üìä

- [ ] Set up performance monitoring
  - [ ] Track Web Vitals metrics
    - Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
    - First Contentful Paint (FCP)
    - Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
  - [ ] Monitor CDN cache hit rates
  - [ ] Set up alerts for timeout errors

- [ ] Implement logging
  - [ ] Track 504 errors
  - [ ] Monitor cold start frequency
  - [ ] Track image optimization metrics

## Expected Outcomes

After implementing these optimizations, we should see:
1. Elimination of initial 504 errors
2. Faster initial page loads
3. Consistent performance across cold starts
4. Reduced bandwidth usage
5. Better user experience with progressive loading

## Progress Tracking

Current Status (as of last update):
1. ‚úì Created Digital Ocean Space (doc-driven-dev-space.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com)
2. ‚úì Configured AWS CLI with Space credentials using profile 'doc-driven-dev-spaces'
3. ‚úì Created and executed image optimization script
   - Converted all images to WebP format
   - Generated responsive sizes (640px, 750px, 828px, 1080px, 1200px, 1920px)
4. ‚úì Successfully uploaded all optimized images to DO Space
5. ‚úì Implemented imageLoader.ts with responsive size handling
6. ‚úì Created environment-specific image handling strategy
7. Next steps:
   - Implement environment-based image loading
   - Update component image references
   - Enable and configure CDN
   - Implement service worker for client-side caching
   - Set up monitoring and logging

## Notes

- Test each optimization in staging before production
- Monitor metrics before and after each change
- Document any configuration changes for team reference
- Consider A/B testing major changes to measure impact
- Keep original images as backup before optimization
- Regular performance audits using Lighthouse
- Monitor CDN costs and adjust caching strategy if needed
