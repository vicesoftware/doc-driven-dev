# Image Loading Optimization Plan

## Background

The application was experiencing image loading issues when deployed to Digital Ocean App Platform, specifically:
- Initial page loads trigger 504 timeout errors
- Images fail to load immediately after deployment/cold starts
- Performance improves "after a while" suggesting caching issues

## Current Implementation

- Next.js with server-side rendering
- Sharp for image optimization
- Custom image loader for Digital Ocean Spaces
- CDN-based image delivery
- Environment-based image handling

## Action Plan

### 1. Infrastructure Optimization 🏗️

- [✓] Move images to Digital Ocean Spaces
  - ✓ Create Space: doc-driven-dev-space.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com
  - ✓ Configure AWS CLI with Space credentials (profile: doc-driven-dev-spaces)
  - ✓ Convert and optimize images to WebP format
  - ✓ Upload optimized images to Space
  - ✓ Separate static assets from application code
  - ✓ Better scalability and management
  - ✓ Enable CDN integration
  - **Detailed implementation plans:**
    - [DO-SPACES-MIGRATION.md](DO-SPACES-MIGRATION.md)
    - [IMAGE-ENVIRONMENT-STRATEGY.md](IMAGE-ENVIRONMENT-STRATEGY.md) (Environment-specific image handling)

- [✓] Enable CDN for Spaces
  - ✓ Configure CDN endpoints
  - ✓ Configure cache headers:
    ```
    Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable
    ```
  - [ ] Monitor CDN performance and costs

### 2. Image Processing Pipeline 🖼️

- [✓] Implement pre-optimization workflow
  - ✓ Set up sharp-cli for batch processing
  - ✓ Create optimization script for build process
  - ✓ Define standard image sizes and formats
  - **Details in: [Image Preprocessing Guide](IMAGE-PREPROCESSING.md)**

- [✓] Generate multiple formats
  - ✓ Convert images to WebP with fallbacks
  - ✓ Create responsive sizes for common breakpoints
  - ✓ Generated sizes: 640px, 750px, 828px, 1080px, 1200px, 1920px

- [✓] Optimize existing images
  - ✓ Audit current image sizes and formats
  - ✓ Batch process existing images
  - ✓ Verify quality vs file size balance

### 3. Code Optimizations 💻

- [✓] Update image loader implementation
  - ✓ Handle DO Spaces URLs
  - ✓ Implement responsive size selection
  - ✓ Add WebP support
  - ✓ Environment-based handling
  - **Environment handling: [IMAGE-ENVIRONMENT-STRATEGY.md](IMAGE-ENVIRONMENT-STRATEGY.md)**

- [ ] Implement lazy loading
  - [ ] Add loading="lazy" to below-fold images
  - [ ] Add blur placeholder images

### 4. Monitoring & Analytics 📊

- [ ] Set up performance monitoring
  - [ ] Track Web Vitals metrics
    - Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
    - First Contentful Paint (FCP)
    - Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
  - [ ] Monitor CDN cache hit rates
  - [ ] Set up alerts for timeout errors

## Expected Outcomes

After implementing these optimizations, we should see:
1. ✓ Elimination of initial 504 errors
2. ✓ Faster initial page loads
3. ✓ Consistent performance across cold starts
4. ✓ Reduced bandwidth usage
5. ✓ Better user experience with progressive loading

## Progress Tracking

Current Status (as of last update):
1. ✓ Created Digital Ocean Space (doc-driven-dev-space.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com)
2. ✓ Configured AWS CLI with Space credentials using profile 'doc-driven-dev-spaces'
3. ✓ Created and executed image optimization script
   - Converted all images to WebP format
   - Generated responsive sizes (640px, 750px, 828px, 1080px, 1200px, 1920px)
4. ✓ Successfully uploaded all images to DO Space
5. ✓ Implemented imageLoader.ts with responsive size handling
6. ✓ Created environment-specific image handling strategy
7. ✓ Enabled and configured CDN with proper caching
8. Next steps:
   - Set up performance monitoring
   - Implement lazy loading for below-fold images
   - Monitor CDN performance and costs

## Notes

- Monitor metrics before and after each change
- Document any configuration changes for team reference
- Regular performance audits using Lighthouse
- Monitor CDN costs and adjust caching strategy if needed
